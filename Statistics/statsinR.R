# Structure of the data set
str(workers)

# The workers data set consists of 500 obs of 6 variables.
# And all variables are of type "int".

# Some changes to the variables:

# Variable "GEN" consists of 2 values that is 1 or 2, which makes them categorical.
# Hence, attaching labels "Male" for 1 and "Female" for 2 and making them as factors.
workers$GEN <- factor(workers$GEN,
                      levels = c(1,2),
                      labels = c("Male", "Female"))

# Simialrly "JOB" consists of 3 values that is 1/2/3 which makes them categorical as well.
# Hence, attaching labels 1 = Public, 2 = Private and 3 = Self-Employed
workers$JOB <- factor(workers$JOB,
                      levels = c(1,2,3),
                      labels = c("Public", "Private", "Self-Employed"))

str(workers)
# Hence, now we see that the two variables ("GEN" and "JOB") are made categorical.
